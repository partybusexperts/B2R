    title: "What Affects Your Transportation Price",
    content: `
      <p>Understanding the factors that influence pricing helps you budget effectively and find the best value for your event.</p>
      
      <h4>Vehicle Type and Size</h4>
      <p>Larger vehicles with more amenities naturally cost more. A 50-passenger party bus with LED lighting and premium sound costs more than a 15-passenger mini bus. Similarly, specialty limousines like Hummer or Escalade stretches command higher rates than standard Lincoln stretches.</p>
      
      <h4>Day and Time</h4>
      <p>Weekend evenings (especially Fridays and Saturdays from 5pm-midnight) are peak demand periods with premium pricing. Weekday daytime rentals often cost 20-30% less. Sunday afternoons and Monday-Thursday evenings offer the best rates.</p>
      
      <h4>Seasonal Demand</h4>
      <p>Prom season (April-June), wedding season (May-October), and holidays (New Year's Eve, Valentine's Day) see highest demand and pricing. Booking during off-peak periods or well in advance can yield significant savings.</p>
      
      <h4>Duration and Distance</h4>
      <p>Most companies set minimum hour requirements (typically 4-5 hours on weekends). Longer rentals may qualify for discounted hourly rates. Extended travel distances may include fuel surcharges or deadhead charges for pickup locations far from the fleet base.</p>
      
      <h4>Location</h4>
      <p>Major metropolitan areas typically have higher rates due to operating costs, traffic considerations, and demand. Rural or suburban pickups may include travel fees if far from the company's base.</p>
    `,

  {
    id: "party-bus-pricing",
    title: "Party Bus Pricing Breakdown",
    content: `
      <p>Party buses represent the best value for medium to large groups seeking an entertainment-focused experience.</p>
      
      <h4>Small Party Buses (15-20 Passengers)</h4>
      <p>Expect $150-$200 per hour for compact party buses. These offer all the fun features—sound systems, LED lighting, and bar areas—in a more intimate setting. Perfect for birthday groups and small friend gatherings.</p>
      
      <h4>Standard Party Buses (25-35 Passengers)</h4>
      <p>The most popular size range, pricing typically falls between $200-$300 per hour. These buses feature expanded dance floors, multiple entertainment zones, and generous amenity packages.</p>
      
      <h4>Mega Party Buses (40-50 Passengers)</h4>
      <p>Premium mega buses range from $300-$400+ per hour. These mobile nightclubs offer the most impressive experience with professional-grade sound, elaborate lighting, and VIP amenities.</p>
      
      <h4>Per-Person Economics</h4>
      <p>Despite higher total costs, party buses often provide the best per-person value. A $300/hour bus for 30 guests over 5 hours costs only $50 per person for the entire experience.</p>

  {
    id: "limo-pricing",
    title: "Limousine Pricing Explained",
    content: `
      <p>Limousine pricing varies significantly based on vehicle type, creating options for every budget.</p>
      
      <h4>Sedan Limousines</h4>
      <p>Luxury sedans (Lincoln Town Car, Mercedes) start around $75-$100 per hour. Perfect for airport transfers, corporate transportation, and intimate occasions for 2-4 passengers.</p>
      
      <h4>Standard Stretch Limousines</h4>
      <p>Classic stretch limos (Lincoln, Chrysler 300) range from $125-$175 per hour, accommodating 8-12 passengers. These remain the most popular choice for weddings, proms, and special occasions.</p>
      
      <h4>SUV Limousines</h4>
      <p>Escalade, Navigator, and Hummer stretches command $200-$300 per hour. These premium vehicles seat 14-20 passengers and make dramatic statements for high-profile events.</p>
      
      <h4>Specialty and Exotic Limousines</h4>
      <p>Vintage vehicles, exotic brands (Bentley, Rolls-Royce), and custom-built specialty limos can exceed $350 per hour. These unique options create truly unforgettable experiences.</p>

    id: "coach-pricing",
    title: "Coach Bus Pricing Guide",
    content: `
      <p>Coach buses offer the most economical per-person pricing for large groups, especially for longer trips.</p>
      
      <h4>Mini Coaches (25-35 Passengers)</h4>
      <p>Compact coaches range from $125-$175 per hour. They navigate city streets easily while providing full coach amenities. Ideal for corporate shuttles and wedding guest transportation.</p>
      
      <h4>Standard Coaches (40-50 Passengers)</h4>
      <p>Full-size motorcoaches typically cost $150-$225 per hour. These workhorses offer the best value for larger groups with restrooms, reclining seats, and entertainment systems.</p>
      
      <h4>Executive Coaches</h4>
      <p>Premium configurations with leather seating, WiFi, and VIP amenities range from $200-$300 per hour. Popular for corporate travel and sports teams.</p>
      
      <h4>Daily vs. Hourly Rates</h4>
      <p>For extended use, many companies offer daily rates ($1,200-$2,500) that provide better value than hourly billing. Multi-day tours receive additional discounts.</p>

  {
    id: "hidden-costs",
    title: "Understanding All Potential Costs",
    content: `
      <p>Transparent pricing requires understanding all potential charges beyond the base hourly rate.</p>
      
      <h4>Gratuity</h4>
      <p>Industry standard is 15-20% of the total rental cost. Some companies include it; others don't. Always confirm whether gratuity is included in your quote.</p>
      
      <h4>Fuel Surcharges</h4>
      <p>Some companies add fuel charges, especially for long-distance travel. Ask about fuel policy when getting quotes.</p>
      
      <h4>Overtime Charges</h4>
      <p>Exceeding your contracted time typically incurs overtime at 1.5x the hourly rate. Build buffer time into your reservation to avoid surprises.</p>
      
      <h4>Cleaning Fees</h4>
      <p>Excessive mess, spills, or damage can result in cleaning charges ranging from $150-$500. Most reasonable use doesn't trigger these fees.</p>
      
      <h4>Tolls and Parking</h4>
      <p>Depending on your itinerary, tolls and parking fees may apply. Some companies include these; others pass them through.</p>
      
      <h4>Airport Fees</h4>
      <p>Airport pickups and dropoffs often include surcharges ($20-$75) to cover airport access fees and waiting time.</p>

    id: "saving-money",
    title: "How to Get the Best Price",
    content: `
      <p>Strategic booking decisions can significantly reduce your transportation costs without sacrificing quality.</p>
      
      <h4>Book Early</h4>
      <p>Reserving 4-6 weeks ahead typically secures better rates and vehicle selection. Last-minute bookings limit options and may include premium charges.</p>
      
      <h4>Choose Off-Peak Times</h4>
      <p>Weekday rentals, daytime hours, and non-peak seasons offer 15-30% savings. Consider Sunday afternoons or Thursday evenings for significant discounts.</p>
      
      <h4>Right-Size Your Vehicle</h4>
      <p>Don't overpay for unused capacity. A vehicle at 75-80% capacity offers comfortable space without wasting money on empty seats.</p>
      
      <h4>Compare Multiple Quotes</h4>
      <p>Get quotes from at least three reputable companies. Prices vary significantly, and competition often yields better deals.</p>
      
      <h4>Ask About Packages</h4>
      <p>Many companies offer package deals for specific events (weddings, proms) or longer rentals that provide better value than hourly billing.</p>
      
      <h4>Negotiate Thoughtfully</h4>
      <p>For large bookings or repeat business, ask about discounts. Many companies offer flexibility, especially during slower periods.</p>
