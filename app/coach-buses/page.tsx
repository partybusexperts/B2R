    title: "What Makes Coach Buses Ideal for Groups",
    content: `
      <p>Coach buses represent the gold standard for comfortable, efficient group transportation. Whether you're organizing a corporate retreat, wedding guest shuttle, or multi-day tour, coaches deliver unmatched value.</p>
      
      <h4>Capacity Meets Comfort</h4>
      <p>Modern coach buses seat 25-56 passengers in airline-style reclining seats with generous legroom. Unlike cramped vehicles, passengers can relax, work, or socialize during travel. Many coaches feature forward-facing seats for motion comfort.</p>
      
      <h4>Onboard Amenities</h4>
      <p>Today's coaches offer climate control, overhead storage, onboard restrooms, WiFi connectivity, power outlets, and entertainment systems. Premium models include tables, refreshment centers, and enhanced suspension for smooth rides.</p>
      
      <h4>Professional Operation</h4>
      <p>Commercial coach drivers maintain CDL certifications, complete rigorous training, and adhere to federal hours-of-service regulations. This professional operation ensures safety and reliability for your group.</p>
      
      <h4>Economic Efficiency</h4>
      <p>When calculated per person, coach travel often costs less than individual car rentals or rideshares. Groups of 20+ especially benefit from the economics of shared transportation.</p>

  {
    id: "coach-types",
    title: "Types of Coach Buses Available",
    content: `
      <p>The coach bus market offers various sizes and configurations to match different group needs and budgets.</p>
      
      <h4>Mini Coaches (25-35 Passengers)</h4>
      <p>Compact coaches perfect for medium-sized groups. They navigate city streets easily while offering most full-size coach amenities. Ideal for corporate shuttles, wedding parties, and day trips.</p>
      
      <h4>Standard Coaches (40-45 Passengers)</h4>
      <p>The most common charter size, balancing capacity with maneuverability. Features include restrooms, climate control, and entertainment systems. Perfect for most group travel needs.</p>
      
      <h4>Full-Size Motorcoaches (50-56 Passengers)</h4>
      <p>Maximum capacity for large groups. These double-axle coaches offer the smoothest ride and most generous amenities. Ideal for tours, conventions, and large wedding groups.</p>
      
      <h4>Executive Coaches</h4>
      <p>Premium configurations with leather seating, table configurations, enhanced entertainment, and VIP amenities. Popular for corporate travel, sports teams, and luxury tours.</p>
      
      <h4>Sleeper Coaches</h4>
      <p>Specialized coaches with bunk beds for overnight travel. Used by touring bands, sports teams, and groups covering long distances who want to travel while passengers rest.</p>
    `,

    id: "corporate-travel",
    title: "Coach Buses for Corporate Events",
    content: `
      <p>Businesses increasingly choose coach buses for group transportation, recognizing the productivity and branding benefits over individual travel.</p>
      
      <h4>Team Building en Route</h4>
      <p>Coach travel transforms transit time into team bonding opportunity. Colleagues can interact, network, and prepare for events together. Many companies use travel time for informal meetings or icebreakers.</p>
      
      <h4>Productivity Features</h4>
      <p>WiFi, power outlets, and table configurations enable work during travel. Executives can conduct calls, review presentations, or hold impromptu meetings—turning travel time into productive time.</p>
      
      <h4>Professional Image</h4>
      <p>Arriving as a group in a clean, modern coach projects professionalism and organization. Some companies brand vehicles with logos for conferences and trade shows.</p>
      
      <h4>Simplified Logistics</h4>
      <p>One vehicle, one schedule, one contact. Group travel eliminates coordination headaches of multiple cars, parking logistics, and arrival timing. Everyone arrives together, on time.</p>
      
      <h4>Cost Control</h4>
      <p>Predictable fixed costs replace variable expenses like parking fees, gas reimbursements, and mileage. Finance teams appreciate straightforward budgeting.</p>

    id: "wedding-shuttles",
    title: "Wedding Guest Shuttle Services",
    content: `
      <p>Guest shuttles have become essential for modern weddings, ensuring smooth logistics and happy guests.</p>
      
      <h4>Why Shuttles Matter</h4>
      <p>Destination weddings, venue parking limitations, and separated ceremony/reception locations all create guest transportation challenges. Shuttles solve these problems elegantly.</p>
      
      <h4>Hotel-to-Venue Service</h4>
      <p>Coordinated pickup from guest hotels eliminates navigation confusion and parking stress. Guests arrive relaxed and ready to celebrate rather than frustrated from logistics.</p>
      
      <h4>Open Bar? No Problem</h4>
      <p>Guest shuttles eliminate drunk driving concerns. Guests can celebrate freely knowing safe transportation is arranged. Many couples consider this a gift to their guests.</p>
      
      <h4>Timeline Management</h4>
      <p>Shuttles help control wedding timeline. Scheduled departure times ensure guests arrive together, and post-reception shuttles provide clear endpoint for celebrations.</p>
      
      <h4>Coordination Tips</h4>
      <p>Work with your venue coordinator and transportation company on timing. Build buffer time for photos. Consider multiple pickup locations for guest convenience.</p>

    title: "Multi-Day Tours and Long-Distance Travel",
    content: `
      <p>Coach buses excel at extended travel, offering comfort and convenience that other options can't match.</p>
      
      <h4>Cross-Country Capability</h4>
      <p>Modern coaches handle any distance with ease. Professional drivers rotate according to DOT regulations, ensuring safety on multi-day journeys. Onboard restrooms minimize stop requirements.</p>
      
      <h4>Luggage Capacity</h4>
      <p>Undercarriage storage compartments hold significant luggage. Most coaches accommodate one large suitcase and one carry-on per passenger, with additional space for equipment or supplies.</p>
      
      <h4>Tour Group Benefits</h4>
      <p>For sightseeing tours, coaches provide consistent, comfortable experience. Groups stay together, guides can narrate from the front, and stops are coordinated for maximum enjoyment.</p>
      
      <h4>Overnight Travel Options</h4>
      <p>Some itineraries benefit from overnight driving while passengers sleep. This maximizes destination time and can reduce hotel costs. Sleeper coaches or reclining seats enable rest during travel.</p>
      
      <h4>Planning Long Trips</h4>
      <p>Work with your charter company on rest stops, meal breaks, and driver requirements. Build flexibility into schedules for traffic and weather. Confirm all permits for multi-state travel.</p>

    title: "How to Book the Right Coach Bus",
    content: `
      <p>Securing the perfect coach requires understanding your needs and asking the right questions.</p>
      
      <h4>Determine Requirements</h4>
      <p>List your passenger count (plan for 10% buffer), pickup/dropoff locations, date/time, and any special needs like ADA accessibility, WiFi, or luggage capacity.</p>
      
      <h4>Start Early</h4>
      <p>Premium coaches book quickly, especially during wedding season, prom weekends, and major events. Begin your search 4-6 weeks in advance for best selection.</p>
      
      <h4>Verify Credentials</h4>
      <p>Confirm the company's DOT number, insurance coverage, and safety record. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration maintains public records of company safety ratings.</p>
      
      <h4>Compare Carefully</h4>
      <p>Get quotes from multiple companies. Compare not just price but vehicle age, amenities, driver experience, and customer reviews. The cheapest option isn't always best value.</p>
      
      <h4>Understand the Contract</h4>
      <p>Review payment terms, cancellation policies, overtime charges, and fuel surcharges. Understand what's included and what costs extra before signing.</p>
