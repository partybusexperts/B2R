    title: "The Elegant History of Limousines",
    content: `
      <p>The limousine has been synonymous with luxury transportation for over a century, evolving from horse-drawn carriages to today's sophisticated vehicles.</p>
      
      <h4>Origins of the Name</h4>
      <p>The term "limousine" derives from Limousin, a region in central France. Local shepherds wore hooded cloaks that resembled the covered compartments on early luxury vehicles. When enclosed automobile bodies became popular, the name stuck.</p>
      
      <h4>The First Luxury Automobiles</h4>
      <p>In the early 1900s, wealthy families commissioned custom-built automobiles with enclosed passenger compartments. These vehicles featured plush interiors, privacy partitions, and professional chauffeurs—establishing the template for modern limousine service.</p>
      
      <h4>The Stretch Revolution</h4>
      <p>In 1928, Armbruster & Company created the first stretch limousine to transport big band musicians. This innovation allowed larger groups to travel in luxury, forever changing the industry.</p>
      
      <h4>Modern Luxury</h4>
      <p>Today's limousines feature fiber optic lighting, premium sound systems, champagne bars, and climate-controlled interiors. The industry continues evolving with hybrid and electric luxury vehicles leading the way.</p>
    `,
  },
  {
    id: "limo-types",
    title: "Types of Limousines Explained",
    content: `
      <p>The limousine market offers diverse options for different occasions and group sizes. Understanding the types helps you choose perfectly.</p>
      
      <h4>Stretch Limousines</h4>
      <p>The classic choice, stretch limos are extended versions of luxury sedans like Lincoln Town Cars and Chrysler 300s. They typically seat 8-12 passengers and feature bar areas, mood lighting, and privacy partitions.</p>
      
      <h4>SUV Limousines</h4>
      <p>Built on platforms like the Cadillac Escalade or Hummer H2, SUV limos offer commanding presence and spacious interiors. They seat 12-20 passengers and feature higher ceilings for easier movement.</p>
      
      <h4>Sedan Limousines</h4>
      <p>Elegant and understated, sedan limos seat 3-4 passengers in pure luxury. Perfect for corporate executives, airport transfers, and intimate occasions where sophistication matters most.</p>
      
      <h4>Exotic and Vintage Limousines</h4>
      <p>For unique occasions, consider exotic models (Bentley, Rolls-Royce) or vintage vehicles (classic Rolls, antique Packards). These create unforgettable photo opportunities and memorable arrivals.</p>
      
      <h4>Specialty Limousines</h4>
      <p>Some companies offer themed vehicles like pink "princess" limos, all-white wedding limos, or custom-built unique designs. These specialty options make specific occasions even more memorable.</p>
    `,
  },
  {
    id: "wedding-limos",
    title: "Limousines for Your Wedding Day",
    content: `
      <p>Your wedding day transportation sets the tone for the entire celebration. Limousines remain the most popular choice for couples seeking elegance and romance.</p>
      
      <h4>Choosing Your Wedding Limousine</h4>
      <p>Consider your wedding style when selecting a vehicle. Classic white stretch limos suit traditional ceremonies, while black SUV limos complement modern celebrations. Vintage vehicles add nostalgic charm.</p>
      
      <h4>Coordinating Wedding Party Transportation</h4>
      <p>Plan transportation for the entire wedding party. The bride typically arrives separately for dramatic effect, while groomsmen and bridesmaids can share larger vehicles. Consider guest shuttles between ceremony and reception.</p>
      
      <h4>Timeline Considerations</h4>
      <p>Build buffer time into your transportation schedule. Allow 30 minutes extra for photos, traffic, and unexpected delays. Coordinate pickup times with your photographer for arrival shots.</p>
      
      <h4>Romantic Touches</h4>
      <p>Many couples request champagne service, "Just Married" signs, and decorated interiors. Discuss customization options with your limousine company well in advance.</p>
      
      <h4>The Grand Exit</h4>
      <p>End your reception with a memorable departure. Your limousine serves as the backdrop for sparkler send-offs and farewell photos—a perfect conclusion to your celebration.</p>

    id: "prom-limos",
    title: "Making Prom Night Unforgettable",
    content: `
      <p>Prom represents a milestone moment for teenagers, and arriving in a limousine adds magic to the memory.</p>
      
      <h4>Group Coordination</h4>
      <p>Prom groups typically range from 6-15 students. Coordinate early to determine group size and split costs fairly. Larger groups can afford more impressive vehicles.</p>
      
      <h4>Parent Considerations</h4>
      <p>Parents appreciate knowing their teens are with professional chauffeurs rather than driving themselves. Many companies offer parent communication packages with pickup confirmations and safe arrival notifications.</p>
      
      <h4>Photography Time</h4>
      <p>Schedule your limousine to arrive early for pre-prom photos. The vehicle makes an excellent backdrop for group shots and adds excitement to the photo session.</p>
      
      <h4>Rules and Expectations</h4>
      <p>Discuss behavior expectations with your group before booking. Most companies have strict no-alcohol policies for prom rentals. Violating policies can result in immediate trip termination.</p>
      
      <h4>Post-Prom Plans</h4>
      <p>Many groups extend rentals for post-prom activities. Discuss safe, supervised after-party options and ensure your rental covers the full evening's timeline.</p>

    title: "Limousine Etiquette and Tips",
    content: `
      <p>Knowing proper limousine etiquette ensures a smooth experience and helps you make the most of your luxury transportation.</p>
      
      <h4>Boarding and Seating</h4>
      <p>Allow the chauffeur to open doors—it's part of the service. Enter feet-first, sliding across seats rather than climbing over. The guest of honor typically sits farthest from the door, entering last and exiting first.</p>
      
      <h4>Interacting with Your Chauffeur</h4>
      <p>Your chauffeur is a professional. Communicate your needs clearly but respect their role. They're not party participants—treat them with the courtesy you'd extend to any service professional.</p>
      
      <h4>Food and Beverages</h4>
      <p>Most limousines allow champagne and light snacks. Avoid messy foods that can stain upholstery. If BYOB is permitted, never bring glass bottles that could break during travel.</p>
      
      <h4>Tipping Guidelines</h4>
      <p>Standard gratuity ranges from 15-20% of the rental cost. Some companies include gratuity in the total; verify before booking. Exceptional service warrants additional recognition.</p>
      
      <h4>End of Service</h4>
      <p>Gather all belongings before exiting. Check for dropped items under seats. Leave the vehicle in the condition you found it—cleaning fees for excessive mess can be significant.</p>

      <p>Securing the right limousine requires planning and asking the right questions. Follow this guide for a smooth booking experience.</p>
      
      <h4>Start Early</h4>
      <p>Premium vehicles book quickly, especially during peak seasons (prom, weddings, holidays). Begin your search 4-6 weeks in advance for best selection. Last-minute bookings limit options significantly.</p>
      
      <h4>Determine Your Needs</h4>
      <p>List your requirements: passenger count, pickup/dropoff locations, event type, and any special requests. This information helps companies match you with appropriate vehicles.</p>
      
      <h4>Compare Multiple Companies</h4>
      <p>Get quotes from at least three reputable companies. Compare not just price but also vehicle age, amenities, insurance coverage, and customer reviews.</p>
      
      <h4>Inspect Before Signing</h4>
      <p>Reputable companies offer vehicle tours. Verify the condition matches photos, amenities work properly, and the interior is clean. Never sign a contract without seeing the actual vehicle.</p>
      
      <h4>Understand the Contract</h4>
      <p>Review payment terms, cancellation policies, overtime rates, and liability clauses carefully. Ask questions about anything unclear before signing.</p>
