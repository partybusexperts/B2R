    title: "Understanding Community Polls",
    content: `Community polls are the heartbeat of the Bus2Ride experience. Unlike generic review sites that only capture post-event feedback, our polling system captures real-time preferences, concerns, and priorities from riders at every stage of the booking journey. This creates an invaluable resource for anyone planning group transportation—whether it's your first party bus rental or your fiftieth corporate shuttle booking.<br><br>Our polls cover everything from pricing expectations to amenity preferences, safety priorities to booking timing. Each vote contributes to a growing database of rider intelligence that helps future customers make more informed decisions. When you vote on a poll, you're not just sharing your opinion—you're contributing to a community knowledge base that benefits everyone.`,

    id: "how-voting-works",
    title: "How Voting Works",
    content: `The voting process is designed to be simple, anonymous, and impactful. When you cast a vote, it's recorded instantly and the poll results update in real-time. You don't need an account to vote, but registered users can track their voting history and see how community preferences change over time.<br><br>Each poll is crafted to address a specific decision point in the transportation booking process. Some polls are straightforward preference questions (LED lights vs. traditional lighting), while others explore more nuanced trade-offs (cost savings vs. newer vehicles). The diversity of poll topics ensures that riders with different priorities all find relevant insights.<br><br>Results are displayed as percentage breakdowns with vote counts, giving you both relative preferences and absolute numbers. High-vote polls carry more statistical weight, while newer polls with fewer votes show emerging trends that may shift as more community members participate.`,

  {
    id: "poll-categories",
    title: "Poll Categories Explained",
    content: `Our polls are organized into intuitive categories that align with common transportation decisions. <strong>Party Bus polls</strong> focus on nightlife, celebrations, and entertainment-focused rentals—think bachelorette parties, birthday celebrations, and concert shuttles. <strong>Limousine polls</strong> address luxury transportation needs including weddings, proms, corporate events, and airport transfers.<br><br><strong>Coach Bus polls</strong> cover group travel, corporate shuttles, school trips, and multi-day excursions where capacity and comfort take priority. <strong>Pricing polls</strong> help you understand what others are paying and expecting, from hourly rates to tipping norms. <strong>Booking Experience polls</strong> capture insights about the reservation process itself—preferred contact methods, contract expectations, and customer service priorities.<br><br>The <strong>Events category</strong> cuts across vehicle types to address specific occasions: weddings, proms, sporting events, concerts, and corporate functions. These polls help you see how others approach transportation for events similar to yours.`,
  },
  {
    id: "using-poll-insights",
    title: "Using Poll Insights for Better Decisions",
    content: `Poll data becomes most powerful when applied to your specific situation. Start by identifying polls relevant to your event type and vehicle preference. If you're planning a bachelorette party, filter to party bus and events categories. Planning a corporate retreat? Focus on coach bus and booking experience polls.<br><br>Look for consensus results (70%+ agreement) as strong indicators of best practices. For example, if 85% of riders say they'd pay more for a newer vehicle, that's a clear signal that vehicle age should factor into your decision. Split results (45-55%) indicate areas where personal preference matters more than community consensus.<br><br>Don't just look at what won—pay attention to the losing options too. If 30% of riders prioritize price over amenities, and you're in that 30%, you know that budget-focused options will serve you well even if they're not the majority preference. Poll insights should inform your decision, not dictate it.`,

  {
    id: "contributing-value",
    title: "Contributing to Community Knowledge",
    content: `Every vote matters. Our poll results are cited by industry publications, used by transportation companies to improve their offerings, and referenced by thousands of event planners each month. When you participate, you're shaping the future of group transportation.<br><br>Beyond voting, consider the context you bring. Polls are most valuable when they reflect diverse perspectives—first-time renters and frequent bookers, budget-conscious planners and luxury seekers, small groups and large parties. Your unique viewpoint adds dimension to our community intelligence.<br><br>We regularly introduce new polls based on emerging trends, seasonal events, and community suggestions. If there's a question you wish we'd asked, reach out through our contact page. The best poll ideas often come from riders facing real decisions.`,
