    question: "What's the biggest mistake first-time renters make?",
    answer: "Not asking about gratuity! About 40% of first-time renters are surprised when 15-20% gratuity is added to their final bill. Always ask upfront if gratuity is included.",
    category: "Booking Tip",
    source: "Industry Survey 2024",

  {
    id: "2",
    question: "When do limousine companies have the most availability?",
    answer: "Tuesday through Thursday evenings have 3x more availability than Saturdays. January and February (post-holiday lull) offer the best selection and often better rates.",
    category: "Insider Tip",
    source: "Fleet Manager Interviews",
  },
  {
    id: "3",
    question: "What percentage of quotes are negotiable?",
    answer: "About 35% of quotes have some flexibility, especially for weekday events or repeat customers. The key is asking politely and being flexible with timing.",

    source: "Dispatcher Interviews",
  },
  {
    id: "4",
    question: "What's the real reason for minimum hour requirements?",
    answer: "It's not greed—it's logistics. Drivers prep, fuel, clean, and position vehicles before your event. A 4-hour minimum covers about 6 hours of actual work time.",

    source: "Fleet Operations Study",
  },
  {
    id: "5",
    question: "What day should you NEVER book a party bus?",
    answer: "Prom Saturday in your area! Rates are highest, vehicles book months ahead, and policies are strictest. Book 8-10 weeks early or consider the Friday before.",
