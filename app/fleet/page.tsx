    title: "How to Choose the Right Vehicle for Your Event",
    content: `
      <p>Selecting the perfect vehicle for your celebration requires careful consideration of several key factors. The right choice can elevate your event from memorable to absolutely unforgettable.</p>
      
      <h4>Consider Your Group Size</h4>
      <p>The first and most crucial factor is your passenger count. Party buses typically accommodate 15-50 guests, making them ideal for bachelor/bachelorette parties, birthday celebrations, and corporate outings. Limousines work best for intimate groups of 6-20, perfect for weddings, proms, and romantic occasions. Coach buses excel for larger groups of 25-56, ideal for corporate events, sports team transportation, and group tours.</p>
      
      <h4>Match the Occasion</h4>
      <p>Different events call for different vibes. A wild bachelorette party demands a party bus with LED lighting and a pumping sound system. A elegant wedding requires a sophisticated limousine with champagne service. A corporate retreat needs a professional coach bus with business amenities. Consider what atmosphere you want to create.</p>
      
      <h4>Duration and Distance</h4>
      <p>Short trips around town are perfect for limousines and party buses. Longer journeys of several hours benefit from coach buses with restrooms, reclining seats, and climate control. Think about comfort needs based on how long guests will be on board.</p>
      
      <h4>Budget Considerations</h4>
      <p>While price shouldn't be the only factor, it's important to understand value. Party buses often provide the best per-person value for medium-sized groups. Limousines offer luxury at premium rates. Coach buses balance capacity with cost-effectiveness for large groups.</p>

  {
    id: "amenities-guide",
    title: "Understanding Vehicle Amenities and Features",
    content: `
      <p>Modern luxury transportation vehicles come equipped with an impressive array of features designed to enhance your experience. Understanding these amenities helps you choose wisely.</p>
      
      <h4>Entertainment Systems</h4>
      <p>Party buses lead the pack with club-quality sound systems featuring subwoofers, multiple speakers, and Bluetooth connectivity. Many include flat-screen TVs, karaoke systems, and even gaming consoles. Limousines offer premium sound with privacy partitions and intercom systems. Coach buses feature overhead entertainment and PA systems.</p>
      
      <h4>Lighting and Atmosphere</h4>
      <p>LED lighting has revolutionized party transportation. Modern party buses feature color-changing LEDs, laser lights, and even fog machines. Limousines use fiber optic starlight ceilings and ambient mood lighting. These elements transform the vehicle interior into an immersive experience.</p>
      
      <h4>Comfort Features</h4>
      <p>Premium leather seating, climate control, and ample legroom are standard across our fleet. Party buses include dance poles, wraparound seating, and bar areas. Limousines feature plush interiors with mini-bars and champagne service. Coach buses offer reclining seats, overhead storage, and onboard restrooms.</p>
      
      <h4>Safety Equipment</h4>
      <p>Every vehicle in our fleet includes modern safety features: GPS tracking, backup cameras, fire extinguishers, first aid kits, and emergency exits. Our chauffeurs undergo extensive training and background checks.</p>

    title: "The Complete Booking Process Explained",
    content: `
      <p>Booking luxury transportation should be as smooth as the ride itself. Here's exactly what to expect when you reserve a vehicle from our fleet.</p>
      
      <h4>Step 1: Get Your Quote</h4>
      <p>Start by providing your event date, pickup/dropoff locations, group size, and any special requirements. Our team will match you with appropriate vehicle options and provide transparent pricing with no hidden fees.</p>
      
      <h4>Step 2: Vehicle Selection</h4>
      <p>Browse available vehicles that meet your criteria. View detailed photos, amenity lists, and capacity information. Our team can schedule in-person tours for major bookings if you want to see the vehicle before committing.</p>
      
      <h4>Step 3: Confirmation and Deposit</h4>
      <p>Secure your booking with a deposit (typically 25-50% of the total). You'll receive a detailed confirmation including pickup times, addresses, driver information, and our policies on gratuity, BYOB rules, and cancellations.</p>
      
      <h4>Step 4: Day-of Coordination</h4>
      <p>Your chauffeur will contact you before your pickup time. They'll arrive 10-15 minutes early to ensure smooth boarding. Throughout your event, they'll handle all logistics while you focus on celebrating.</p>
      
      <h4>Step 5: Post-Event</h4>
      <p>After your trip, we'll send a follow-up email for feedback. We value your input and use it to continuously improve our service.</p>

    id: "pricing-factors",
    title: "What Affects Your Rental Price",
    content: `
      <p>Understanding pricing helps you budget effectively and find the best value for your event. Here are the primary factors that influence your quote.</p>
      
      <h4>Vehicle Type and Size</h4>
      <p>Larger vehicles with more amenities command higher rates. A 50-passenger party bus with premium features costs more than a standard 15-passenger bus. Stretch limousines are priced differently than SUV limos. Consider your actual needs versus wants.</p>
      
      <h4>Duration of Rental</h4>
      <p>Most rentals have minimum hour requirements (typically 3-5 hours). Hourly rates may decrease for longer rentals. All-day packages often provide better value than hourly rates for extended events.</p>
      
      <h4>Day and Season</h4>
      <p>Weekend evenings (Friday and Saturday) are peak demand times. Prom season (April-May), wedding season (May-October), and holidays see higher rates. Booking mid-week or during off-peak seasons can offer significant savings.</p>
      
      <h4>Location and Distance</h4>
      <p>Pickup location affects pricing based on distance from our fleet garage. Extended travel to remote locations may include fuel surcharges. Multiple stops and complex itineraries can impact total cost.</p>
      
      <h4>Additional Services</h4>
      <p>Red carpet service, special decorations, champagne packages, and extended wait times are available add-ons. Some are complimentary; others carry additional fees.</p>
