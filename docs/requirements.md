HOMEPAGE

This is the hero header to be put into supabase as the main hero section. I like the hero header here for every page that requires a hero header. The only pages that don't need a hero header are the fleet pages, the polls page and the poll results page. We just need 3 rotating pictures of vehicles in the header of every page for now. The vehicle pics are in supabase storage vehicles1.

For the first main party bus section and then limos and then coach buses, the boxes are the right size and everything looks good as is except we need a learn more button within the bottom right of the main photo, and the buttons at the bottom look a little pixelated compared to the buttons in the hero section, do you see this? Also chauffeur included in white at the top left is too white, you can’t see it much, also we need an arrow to the right and to the left of this section so people understand taht this isnt the fleet page and anywhere they click on anything here, will take them straight to the party bus fleet page and same for the limos and coach buses, all should look the same on this page, also, not that this matters for this section, but when you click on the images below the main photo, it stalls for a bit or something, Also, for all these sections, it should never feature the same vehicle at one time, i think thats it for this section. This section will be put on many other pages, perhaps all pages, and same thing applies, any click sends them to the fleet page

Why party buses rock and why limos rock is not good, it should be changed to the why party buses rock section on the party bus fleet page. Its much bigger. Lets change it out and make it in supabase. The modal is great but the modal looks even better on the tools page when you click on a random tool, see how that modal looks? That looks good.

The review section on the homepage is great but add a search bar and a simple checkbox thing for customers to click on like so they can select reviews that are about party buses only, or about on time, or whatever, you can use ai for this. Other than that, the review section is good to be put everywhere it is currently on the site

I dont see the polls sections anymore so we need to recreate them. It should be in line with the rest of the site as far as styling goes and haver 3 columns, the first column is made for the appropriate poll category, and then use AI to figure out what the other two columns should be and they can be rotated like we discussed

The tools section on the home page is great, lets keep this for the tools section on all pages, there are a ton of tools and ideally we rotate them but not completely as there are tools that would be better on certain pages like pricing tools on the pricing page for example, we would need to use AI for this but the tools section here is good to put into supabase for the rest of the site

The homepage faq is great here for putting into supabase as the faq question template, where you can click see more and get more and more. And also, every faq section should be completely unique to each page. I guess we can have some faqs that are the same but the vast majority should bbe different

Okay that is all that we see on the homepage now but we need to add an events section which on desktop features 6 events, 2 rows of 3 each randomized so they show up differently and have a see more events button below, the boxes and the styling can be taken from this site http://localhost:3000/events. We dont need a button that says Related Polls, it can be changed to Live Quote.

Party bus, limo, and coach bus fleet pages

The boxes should be styled like they look on the homepage after you made the above corrections but no arrows pointing right or left obviously because this is the fleet page and no need to show customers that there are more. Please fix the clicking on the photos below so when you click on one, it shows up above, also the learn more button which will eventually go to the individual fleet page for that vehicle.

There needs to be a search bar at the top and a checklist for people to click and find vehicles easily, sort them, we can ask ai how to coordinate this

The why party buses rock section here is good, its more expansive than the homepage one

The we also have limos and coach buses section is great, no changes here and it can be put into supabase as the official section for this,

How the bus2ride.com booking process works is great, lets make this in supabase too to use across the rest of the site

The review section can be the same as the homepage one that you have modified above.

The polls need to be done as i explained in the homepage section

Tools page needs to be supabase tools section explained in homepage

Then events page can be put here as discussed in homepage at bottom

Faq section can be put here as discussed in homepage section

EVENTS PAGE

Aside from the changes to the box styling that I mention above, this page is good so far

Review section should be from supabase at this point,

Need polls next from supabase

Then fleet page section like top of homepage with party buses, limos and coach buses and why those vehicles rock

Then tools section

Then faq section

PRICING PAGE

Okay pricing data needs to be put into supabase but i like the section at the top, needs more prominent search bar and clickable stuff like for viewers that only want to click and see pricing questions about minimum hourly rentals, or just about party buses, etc. AI can help configure the details of this.

Then below we need standard supabase review section

Then polls section

Then fleet page sections as in events page above, just like that

Then tools section

Then faq,

Then events section featuring 6 events and more button like we discussed above.

The location page is fine as is, perhaps put polls below, then a fleet section, then tools, then reviews, then faq

http://localhost:3000/locations/anchorage this is the individual local location page. We need 3 pages for each of these cities (PARTY BUSES, LIMOUSINES, AND COACHBUSES) and we need one page for each state.

For this page, we need a hero section at the top,

The font on this page is too small, needs to be more like the rest of the site

For anchorage events that love party buses, lets make these modals so they open like the rest of the site, same type of modal styling and make boxes not rectangles, make sense?

Sample anchorage night out ….. Should be more detailed, maybe another photo on the left so it looks more attractive

Anchorage neighborhood vibes and seasonal guide for buses should be modals as well below

Anchorage party bus trivia and fun facts, this section needs to be redone so its more spicy, bigger font, more of them, organized better, lets mess with this

Live anchorage conditions, we need to include live weather and traffic here but in a bigger section than it is, and we need to use the appropriate apis to get this done and look good

Layer in more feeds, i want to do as much as we can here without costing a ton of money, if the feeds are free, lets connect with them. Let me know what you need me to sign up for here

Get rid of the supabase powered social proof section and then below put the supabase reviews section

Then polls

Then fleet secretions like homepage has,

Then tools, then events,

Then faq

At bottom, ready to plan your anchorage party bus, this is fine, keep this.

STATE TEMPLATE

Okay, lets use the local city template as the state template as well, but lets make all the changes above first and lets approve them and use that same template for state. Make sense?

POLLS PAGE

This page i think looks good, lets keep it this way unless you can think of an easier faster way to show people the polls. I dont like how people have to click so many times to see the polls, i want to make it easier but it was so slow when i did it any other way. Do you have any ideas?

But below the polls should be reviews

Then fleet pages

Then tools

Then events

Then faq

BLOG PAGE

The blog page used to look good and I dont know what happened. I like how it looks now but it needs to have the pictures that are in supabase storage work in there, and interspersed with the blogs should be some cta or info or something to break it up so its just not rows and rows of boring bog posts,

Need a search bar and clickable checklists to help hone down blog posts people want to see

I like how it has like the blog amenities below the main picture, how do we make those clickable and then show all blog posts with that amenity,

Then below blog posts, we need fleet sections

Then reviews

Polls

Tools

Events

Faqs

http://localhost:3000/blog/party-bus-pricing-101

Okay this is the individual blog post page

We need hero section that is in supabase, and i like how the top of the page looks now but the info is odd and should be catered to what that blog post is about

The actual blog post at the top isnt normal, it needs a title right?

Get rid of build your own model

Use our own faq in supabase

Interactive estimator is cool but does that apply to the blog post at hand?

Cost signals in real time section, i dont know what this has to do with the blog posts but i think it looks cool but all this stuff and info needs to be related to the blog post. I love how this is a blog post but its more like a web page with all kinds of other info

From inquiry to rolling wheels section….. Get rid of this

Get rid of actual vehicles staged this week

Get rid of playbooks,

Okay so we need the above and then fleet ssections, polls, tools, faq, events, the same as the other pages

TOOLS PAGE

Launch ready charter ops stack, i love how this looks but how does it relate to tools?

So the tools section looks good but what is the circle to teh left of each tool? I love the modal with the cta in it, thats great looking, perhaps we could use that type of modal more often around the site?

Then below tools we need fleet sections, reviews, then polls, then tools, then faq, then events

Get rid of the other stuff

FAQ PAGE

Need hero section

I love the part that is currently at the top but lets make it more faq related

I like how the layout is but the styling isn’t the same as the rest of the site, its too dark, needs more blue

I like most clicked this week section below all the faqs, but then do reviews, fleet sections that forward to fleet page appropriately, then polls, then events, then tools, then faq

INDUSTRY SECRETS PAGE

Does top portion relate to industry secrets? I like how it looks but how do we make it catered to industry secrets

Okay the industry secrets look dumb here. We need standardized boxes that are like the rest of the site, the modals are cool but make them more like the tools page modals

I like the ctas and info that break up the industry secrets so its not just rows and rows

Need more noticeable search bar and clickable checklists or whatever to hone in on industry secretes by categories

Below industry secrets section, fleet sections, then polls, then reviews, then events, then tools, then faq,

POLL RESULTS

Im not even sure how to do this, it has to be simple for people to find data on whatever they want by whatever category, needs probably to look similar to polls page but give all results, should be section at top that has cool stats about the polls, most popular poll, etc. Some facts,

Below poll results would be fleet sections, polls, reviews, tools, events, faq

REVIEWS PAGE

Top part should be reviews related

Review section looks good but too dark, needs to be like rest of site, more blue but not too much

Then fleet section, then polls, then events, then tools, then faq

I like contact us page how its laid out, shouldnt have in there lock in my quote, but its okay to give ballpark numbers, i can configure this

Contact form is hard to see

Response sla, put something elser here, maybe trivia, maybe facts, maybe both?

Coverage locks section? Make this related

Below where WHY OUR REPLIES FEEL INSTANT should be how to book party bus which should already be in supabase

Then fleet, then reviews, then polls, then events, then faq

INDIVIDUAL FLEET VEHICLE PAGE

http://localhost:3000/vehicles/10-passenger-white-chrysler-300-limo

This page needs larger font, and more blue

Get rid of spec sheet

Okay below teh actual individual fleet section for that vehicle, we need like 3 other limos and why lijmos rock, then party buses, then coach buses,

Then reviews, polls, tools, events, and faq

SAMPLE EVENTS PAGE INDIVIDUAL PAGE

There is this scrolling bar or cta at the bottom, i dont think we need this

Everything is fine down to popular vehicles for fright night. This should be more events to show customer. Then fleet sections, party buses, limos, coach buses

Get rid of plug in your city section

Get rid of set mood before you roll

I love the section make the scares fun not stressful, move this up above so it aligns with the haunted house stuff at the top

Then we need polls, tools, reviews, and faq
