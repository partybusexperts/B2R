Absolutely — if you want the most impressive, addictive, high-engagement poll analytics hub, I can add MANY more metrics that real people love to click.

I’ll give you:

Expanded stats list (15–25 metrics people actually care about)

How to present them in UI (clickable → deep links)

Exact instructions you will paste into Replit

This will turn your Polls page into something that feels like TikTok Analytics + Trivia Leaderboards + Reddit Trending.

✅ THE STATS PEOPLE LOVE (ADD ALL OF THESE)

These are metrics users naturally click because they trigger curiosity, competition, and FOMO.

🔥 ENGAGEMENT-BASED METRICS
1. Fastest Rising Polls (last 15 minutes)

People love seeing what's suddenly blowing up.

submitted_at > now() - interval '15 minutes'
GROUP BY poll_id
ORDER BY count(*) DESC

2. Most Answered Polls Today

Sorted by today’s activity.

3. Most Skipped Polls

(If user skips or backs out — optional tracking)

4. Highest Completion Rate Polls

Polls where people finish the whole series (if you have multi-question sets later)

5. Polls With Most Comments or Discussion (future-ready)

Even if comments not built yet, you can add a placeholder metric.

🎯 ACCURACY-BASED METRICS
6. Hardest Polls (lowest correct %)

People LOVE to test themselves on the “hard ones.”

7. Easiest Polls (highest correct %)
8. Most Misleading Polls

Polls where the most-chosen wrong answer is consistent.

9. Fastest Average Response Time Polls

Later you can add response time tracking — but add the column now.

🏆 CATEGORY-BASED METRICS
10. Trending Categories (last hour)
11. Most Completed Category Today
12. Most Popular Category All-Time
13. Newest Category Added

Links directly to newest category page.

👤 USER-INTERACTION METRICS

(Not personal — all anonymized)

14. Average Answers per User (global)
15. % of users who answered at least 1 poll today
16. Completion streaks (gamification later)
🗺️ GEOGRAPHIC-STYLE METRICS (fun even without real location)
17. Most active city page

(based on your future location pages)

18. States with most poll submissions this week

Even if users aren’t from the U.S., it still builds personality.

🧨 VIRAL STYLE METRICS
19. Most Shared Polls

(If you track share/copy link events)

20. Most Repeated Polls

Polls users redo multiple times.

📅 TIME-BASED METRICS
21. Polls created this week
22. Polls with growing momentum (week-over-week increase)
23. Poll that was most popular 24 hours ago (yesterday’s winner)
🎰 RANDOM DISCOVERY METRICS

These make people click.

24. “Random Poll of the Hour”

Pick a random poll each hour and highlight it.

25. “Poll Spotlight: Hidden Gem”

Randomly surface a poll with low views.

🎯 UI BEHAVIOR (IMPORTANT)
Every stat block should be clickable.

When the user clicks a stat card:

If it’s a poll → go to that poll

If it’s a category → open that category page

If it’s a time-based metric → open sorted Polls list

If it's “Hardest Polls” → go to list page showing hardest polls

If it’s “Trending Now” → go to trending list

Replit must build:

✔ Routing
✔ Sorting logic
✔ Category filters
✔ Poll detail pages
🔥 INSTRUCTIONS TO GIVE REPLIT (EXPANDED VERSION)

Copy–paste this whole block into Replit:

✅ MASTER COMMAND FOR REPLIT — EXTENDED ANALYTICS VERSION
Extend the poll analytics system with a full analytics dashboard and clickable stats.

1. Modify Supabase tables:

In polls table add:
  popularity_score (int)
  views_count (int)
  submissions_count (int)
  correct_count (int)
  incorrect_count (int)
  avg_response_time (float)
  streak_score (int)
  share_count (int)
  skip_count (int)
  last_submission_at (timestamptz)
  created_at (timestamptz default now())
  updated_at (timestamptz default now())

In poll_submissions add:
  response_time_ms (int)
  was_skipped (boolean)
  was_shared (boolean)

2. Create analytics queries for:

- Most popular polls (submissions_count)
- Hottest polls (submissions in past 60 min)
- Fastest rising polls (last 15 min)
- Trending polls (last 7 days)
- New polls (created_at DESC)
- Highest correct-answer %
- Lowest correct-answer % (hardest polls)
- Highest incorrect-answer % (misleading polls)
- Most skipped polls
- Most shared polls
- Most repeated polls
- Fastest average response time polls
- Categories trending in last hour
- Most active categories all-time
- Polls created this week
- Poll with biggest week-over-week growth
- Random “poll of the hour”
- Hidden gem polls (low views)

3. Add an expanded Live Stats Bar to the top of Polls and Poll Results pages. Show:

- Polls submitted in last 5 min / 60 min / today / 7 days
- Total submissions all-time
- Total polls in database
- Most active category right now
- Fastest rising poll
- Hardest poll
- Easiest poll
- Trending category
- Random poll of the hour
- Hidden gem poll
- Most shared poll
- Most skipped poll
- Poll created most recently
- Poll that was most popular yesterday

4. Make every stat block clickable:

- If it refers to a poll → go directly to that poll
- If it refers to a category → open category filter view
- If it is a time-based metric → open list sorted by that metric

5. Add filter tabs:

Popular
Trending
Rising
New
Categories
Hardest
Easiest
Most Skipped
Most Shared
Fastest Time
Most Answers Today
Hidden Gems

Each tab must query Supabase using the proper analytics query.

6. Cache analytics on the server for 30–60 seconds for speed.

7. Build a clean 2-row card grid layout for stats at the top of pages.

8. Ensure analytics works on both:
- Polls listing page
- Individual Poll Results page

Implement all UI, server routes, queries, and Supabase changes required.
