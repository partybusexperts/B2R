## Global Component Rules

### Hero Section

- **Used on:** All pages **except** Fleet pages, Polls page, Poll Results page.
- Fetch hero by slug from Supabase.
- Rotating carousel of 3 vehicle images from `vehicles1` storage.

### Fleet Preview Section

- Large main photo + small thumbnails below.
- **"Learn More"** button in bottom-right of main photo.
- Fix pixelated buttons (match hero button quality).
- Increase contrast for "Chauffeur Included" badge (white text hard to see).
- **Homepage only:** Show left/right arrows; clicking anywhere routes to fleet page.
- Never show same vehicle twice across sections.
- Thumbnail click should instantly update main photo (no stall).

### "Why X Rocks" Section

- Use expanded version from fleet pages (not homepage mini version).
- Store in Supabase as `content_sections`.
- Modal styling should match Tools page modal (better looking).

### Reviews Section

- Add **search bar** + **checkbox filters** (filter by vehicle type, "on time", etc.).
- AI-assisted tagging for filter categories.
- Consistent across all pages.

### Polls Section

- **3-column layout:**
  - Column 1 = contextual poll for current page category
  - Columns 2–3 = AI-suggested/rotated polls
- Recreate styling to match site theme.

### Tools Section

- Grid layout with **modal popups** (use Tools page modal style everywhere).
- Rotate tools contextually (e.g., pricing tools on pricing page).
- Store in Supabase for dynamic rotation.

### Events Section

- **Desktop:** 2 rows × 3 columns (6 events), randomized order.
- **Mobile:** Stacked.
- "See more events" button below.
- Change "Related Polls" button → **"Live Quote"**.

### FAQ Section

- Supabase-driven template with "See more" expansion.
- **Page-context filtering** — vast majority should be unique per page.
- Some FAQs can repeat across pages but keep it minimal.
