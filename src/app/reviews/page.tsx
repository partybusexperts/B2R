They kept me informed with arrival time and were prompt when I asked a last minute question. They accommodated all of our requests - made the party the BEST experience and party EVER! Our driver, Jim, was laid back, polite, and happily took the girls whenever they wanted to ride! This is THE BEST service ever and I would HIGHLY recommend using them. You talk directly to the owner and the price can not be beat!!! Thank you Accent for making all our 10th birthday dreams come true!!! You guys are the BEST!"
