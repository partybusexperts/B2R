  <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">Many of our party buses feature a removable dance pole, perfect for those who want to add a little extra excitement to their celebration. The pole is securely installed for safety, but can be removed if you prefer more open space. Use it for dancing, party games, or just as a fun photo prop. Itâ€™s a unique feature that sets our buses apart and gives your group more ways to enjoy the ride. Whether youâ€™re planning a bachelorette party, birthday, or just a wild night out, the removable dance pole adds a playful touch to your event. Ask about this feature when booking to make sure your bus has it!</p>
